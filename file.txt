Problem: Determine if a word reads the same forwards and backward.
 Start with two pointers, one at the beginning of the word and one at the end of the word.
 Compare the letters at these positions. Are they the same?
 If they are the same, move the forward pointer one step forward and the backward pointer one step backward.
 Keep comparing and moving the pointers until they meet in the middle or cross each other.
 If you reach the point where the two pointers meet, or if they cross each other and all comparisons were the same, then it's a palindrome!
